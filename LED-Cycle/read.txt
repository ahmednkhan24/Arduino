## Objective

* Get familiar with the Arduino programming environment.
* Learn how to build a circuit to connect external components to the Arduino.
* Learn how to program the Arduino to control external components.
* Bonus: Pretty blinking lights.

Use the onboard LED on pin 13, a red led on a second digital pin, and a green led on a third digital pin. 

These cycle so only one LED is on at any given point in time. Onboard LED should turn on, then it should turn off and your red LED should turn on, then it should turn off and your green LED should turn on, then onboard, then red, then green, etc . . .

The digital pins should be labeled 0-13 on your board.

Each off-board LED should be connected to a 220 Ohm resistor.
