# Final Project - SClock
This assignment is the semester-long final project my two partners and I created for CS 362 - Computer Design - at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 

We created a cool alarm clock that has tons of features any regular alarm clock should have, but then we went above and beyond to implement additional features that we thought would make the project unique.
